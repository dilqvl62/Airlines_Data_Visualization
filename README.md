# Project: Choose_your_flight

## Overview
Choose_Your_flight is an engaging project that presents a story about US airline on-time performance through visualization. 
This project uses Python Flask-powered API, Pandas, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, D3, and PostgreSQL database. I am going to take the following approach:
  1. Problem definition
  2. Data
  3. ETL using Jupyter Notebook
  4. Databse using PostgreSQL
  5. Creating API using Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy
  6. Interactivity using JavaScript and D3 for data visualization
  7. Web developement using HTML/CSS

## 1. Problem Definition
Given a historic flight in the USA, can we create a visualization that empower air traveleres to make informed decision about their choice of airline ?

## 2. Data
I obtained the data from [the Bureau of Transportation Statistics Website](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp).
